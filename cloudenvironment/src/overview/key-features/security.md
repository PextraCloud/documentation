# Security

**Pextra CloudEnvironment速** is built with a security-first approach, ensuring that all workloads, data, and resources are protected against modern threats. From encryption to advanced access control mechanisms, Pextra provides a comprehensive suite of security features designed to safeguard your cloud infrastructure.

By integrating security at every layer, Pextra CloudEnvironment速 ensures compliance, data privacy, and robust protection for both physical and virtual environments.

## Key Features

1. **Data Encryption (Beta)**

   - **In-Transit Encryption**: Secures data as it moves between servers, virtual machines, and storage systems using industry-standard protocols like TLS.
   - **At-Rest Encryption**: Protects stored data with AES-256 encryption, ensuring it remains secure even in case of unauthorized access.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (Beta)**  
   Manage access permissions by assigning roles to users and services. Limit access based on the principle of least privilege (PoLP) to reduce risk.

3. **Identity and Access Management (IAM) (Beta)**

   - Integrate with Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for secure access.
   - Centralized management of users, groups, and permissions.

4. **Network Security (Beta)**

   - **Firewalls**: Define granular rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
   - **Micro-Segmentation (Beta)**: Isolate workloads within the same network to limit exposure.
   - **VPN and Secure Gateways**: Ensure secure connectivity for hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

5. **Security Logging and Monitoring (Beta)**

   - Collect and analyze logs for audit trails and threat detection.
   - Integrate with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems for real-time monitoring and alerts.

6. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention (Beta)**  
   Use built-in intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to monitor and block suspicious activities in real time.

7. **Automated Security Updates (Beta)**  
   Regularly update underlying systems and software to patch vulnerabilities and maintain compliance with the latest security standards.

8. **Security for Virtualized Resources (Beta)**
   - Isolated virtual machine and container environments prevent cross-tenant attacks.
   - Secure container orchestration with integrated tools like Podman速 and Docker速.
