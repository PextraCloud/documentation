# GPU Virtualization Support (Beta)

**Pextra CloudEnvironment®** includes robust support for **GPU virtualization**, enabling advanced compute workloads to leverage GPU resources effectively. This feature allows users to run GPU-accelerated tasks on virtual machines (VMs) or containers with seamless integration, ensuring optimized performance for AI, machine learning, rendering, and other GPU-intensive applications.

## Key Features

1. **Automatic GPU Detection**  
   Pextra CloudEnvironment® automatically detects the GPUs available on physical nodes during setup. This eliminates the need for manual configuration and ensures that all GPU resources are ready for virtualization.

2. **GPU Monitoring**  
   Real-time monitoring of GPU resources provides detailed insights into:

   - GPU usage and workload distribution.
   - Memory utilization for each GPU.
   - Temperature and performance metrics.

3. **GPU Pass-Through Virtualization**  
   For maximum performance, **Pextra CloudEnvironment®** enables GPU pass-through virtualization, which directly assigns physical GPU resources to virtual machines. This ensures that applications running within VMs have near-native GPU performance, allowing for better utilization of GPU resources.

4. **Efficient Resource Allocation**  
   Supports sharing GPUs across multiple VMs or containers using virtualized GPU frameworks, optimizing resource distribution for high-demand workloads.

5. **Workload Optimization**  
   Pextra’s GPU virtualization ensures better utilization of GPU resources by distributing workloads efficiently. Users can maximize performance without underutilizing hardware.

## Benefits of GPU Virtualization

- **Accelerated Compute Performance**: Leverage GPUs to handle computationally intensive tasks with ease.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Ensure that GPU resources are neither idle nor overallocated, optimizing performance for various workloads.
- **Scalability**: Dynamically allocate GPUs to VMs or containers based on workload demands.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Enable high-performance compute tasks without the need for dedicated, standalone GPU servers.
- **Ease of Use**: Automatic GPU detection and pass-through make configuring and managing GPU virtualization simple.

## Use Cases

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)**  
   Train and deploy AI/ML models faster by leveraging GPU-accelerated environments.

- **3D Rendering and Animation**  
   Render high-quality graphics and animations efficiently using virtualized GPU resources.

- **Video Encoding and Streaming**  
   Enable real-time video encoding, decoding, and streaming tasks with GPU power.

- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**  
   Perform simulations, scientific computations, and other HPC workloads with ease.

## Getting Started with GPU Virtualization

1. **Verify GPU Availability**  
   Ensure that physical nodes in your **Pextra CloudEnvironment®** have GPUs installed. The platform will automatically detect and list the available GPUs.

2. **Monitor GPU Resources**  
   Navigate to the **GPUs** tab to view real-time GPU utilization, memory usage, and other performance metrics.

3. **Enable GPU Pass-Through Virtualization (Beta)**  
   Assign GPUs directly to virtual machines using the pass-through option available in the **VM Settings**. This ensures near-native GPU performance for the selected VMs.

4. **Configure Workloads**  
   Deploy applications that require GPU acceleration on VMs or containers with GPU support. The **Pextra CloudEnvironment®** will handle the GPU resource allocation seamlessly.

5. **Optimize GPU Usage**  
   Monitor workloads and redistribute GPU resources as needed to achieve optimal performance and resource utilization.

## Conclusion

The **GPU Virtualization Support (Beta)** feature in **Pextra CloudEnvironment®** enables users to harness the full power of GPUs for a wide range of demanding applications. By combining automatic GPU detection, monitoring, and pass-through virtualization, Pextra ensures that users can maximize performance and resource efficiency while simplifying GPU management in their cloud infrastructure.
