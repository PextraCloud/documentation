# Tips for Support Tickets
To ensure that your support ticket is effective and leads to a quick resolution, follow these tips:

1. **Be specific**: Provide precise details about what you were doing when the issue occurred.

2. **Include context**: Mention your environment details, such as hardware specifications, current version, and any recent changes.

3. **Attach logs**: Always include relevant logs (see [Gathering Diagnostic Information](../diagnostic-information.md)).

4. **Document steps to reproduce**: List the exact steps someone would need to follow to encounter the same issue.

5. **Describe expected vs. actual behavior**: Explain what you expected to happen and what actually happened.

6. **Add screenshots**: Visual evidence can help the support team understand the issue more quickly.
