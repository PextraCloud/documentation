# Installation

Use this section to perform a complete installation of Pextra CloudEnvironment®. Work through the tasks in order so every node boots a verified image and completes the guided installer successfully.

1. [Download the installer ISO](./downloading.md) from the Pextra portal that matches your release channel.
2. [Verify the checksum](./verifying.md) before you trust the media, especially when mirroring ISOs internally.
3. [Prepare bootable media](./preparing.md) for the servers you plan to image (USB for bare metal, virtual media for remote KVMs).
4. [Boot the hardware](./booting.md) from that media and confirm the BIOS/UEFI order, serial console, and remote management access.
5. [Run the guided installer](./steps.md) on every node, entering license details and networking information when prompted.
