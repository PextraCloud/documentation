# Monitoring and Metrics

Pextra CloudEnvironment® provides a comprehensive **Monitoring and Metrics** dashboard, allowing administrators to observe and manage the health, performance, and resource usage of clusters, nodes, and instances.

## Viewing Available Monitoring Metrics

To access monitoring metrics:

1. Select the **cluster**, **node**, or **instance** in the left navigation panel.
2. On the right-hand panel, the **Monitoring** section displays key metrics, organized under three main categories: **Cluster**, **Node**, and **Instance**.

> [!Tip] 
> To view monitoring metrics, click on the specific **resource**—whether a cluster, node, or instance—in the left navigation panel. This will open the monitoring dashboard for that resource on the right-hand panel.
