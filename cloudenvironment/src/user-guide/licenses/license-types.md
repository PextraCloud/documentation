# License Types

Pextra Cloud Environment® provides two primary license categories:

1. **Community Licenses**
2. **Enterprise Licenses**

All licenses are managed through the **customer portal**: [https://portal.pextra.cloud/](https://portal.pextra.cloud)

## Community Licenses

Community licenses are intended for **learning, evaluation, and non-production environments**, including:
- Home labs
- Development and testing environments
- Small non-production deployments
- Academic research and student training

Community licenses **do not include** enterprise-grade features, such as:
- Multi-organization support
- Multi-data center deployments
- Multi-cluster management
- ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)

These licenses are designed for **simplicity and lightweight deployment**, making them ideal for experimentation and educational use.

> [!TIP]
> Community licenses are perfect for getting started with Pextra Cloud Environment® without the complexity of enterprise features.

## Enterprise Licenses

Enterprise licenses are designed for **production workloads and business-critical environments** requiring advanced capabilities and enterprise support. Features include:
- Multi-tenant environments (supporting multiple organizations)
- ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)
- Advanced security, governance, and management capabilities

Multiple tiers of Enterprise licenses are available. All Enterprise license management, including purchase, assignment, and renewal, is performed via the **customer portal**.

> [!TIP]
> Opt for Enterprise licenses when you require advanced access control, multiple organizations, or production-level support and governance.

## Enterprise Edition Indicator

In the Pextra Cloud Environment® web UI, the **edition indicator** is located under the logo in the top-left corner.

If **any cluster** in your environment has an Enterprise license, the UI will display **Enterprise Edition**.

> [!TIP]
> Even a single Enterprise-licensed cluster will trigger the Enterprise Edition indicator, providing clear visibility across your environment.
