# Node Management

This section provides guidance for managing **individual nodes** within your Pextra Cloud Environment® deployment.

Nodes represent the **physical or virtual servers**[^1] that run Pextra Cloud Environment®. They form the backbone of your infrastructure, providing **compute, storage, and network resources** necessary for your deployment.

Each node is uniquely identified by an ID, which uses the prefix `node-`[^2].

## Notes

[^1]: Running Pextra Cloud Environment® inside a virtual machine is currently in **beta**. For experimentation, you can even run Pextra Cloud Environment® within Pextra Cloud Environment® itself.  
[^2]: All resources in Pextra Cloud Environment® are assigned **unique identifiers**. Node IDs start with `node-` followed by a unique string (e.g., `node-qthm_iLrflJ_DtSS1l4Gx`).
