# Node Management
This section provides a guide to managing individual nodes within your deployment.

Nodes are the physical or virtual servers[^1] that run Pextra CloudEnvironment®. They serve as the foundation of your infrastructure, providing the compute, storage, and network resources required by your deployment.

The ID prefix for nodes is `node-`[^2].

## Notes

[^1]: Running Pextra CloudEnvironment® in a virtual machine is in beta. Try running Pextra CloudEnvironment® inside of Pextra CloudEnvironment®!
[^2]: Resources in Pextra CloudEnvironment® are identified by unique IDs. Node IDs will have the prefix `node-`, followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `node-qthm_iLrflJ_DtSS1l4Gx`).
