# AI Features
The Pextra CloudEnvironment® web interface includes two AI integrations:
- [Pextra Cortex™ (beta)](./pextra-cortex.md): A fully-capable AI agent for planning and executing complex orchestration tasks within Pextra CloudEnvironment®.

- [AI Assist](./ai-assist.md): Context-sensitive AI completion and suggestions.

> [!NOTE]
> An administrator of the organization [must configure at least one AI provider](../../organizations/ai-providers/add.md) for AI features to function. If no AI providers are configured, AI features will not be available in the web interface.
