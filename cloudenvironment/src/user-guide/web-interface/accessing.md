# Accessing the Web Interface
You can access the Pextra CloudEnvironmentÂ® web interface by entering the management IP address in your web browser. The default URL is `https://<management-ip>:5007`, where `<management-ip>` is the IP address you configured during the installation process.

> [!NOTE]
> The web interface uses HTTPS for secure communication. You will see a self-signed certificate warning in your browser. This is normal, as the certificate is generated during the installation process. You can safely ignore this warning and proceed to the web interface.
