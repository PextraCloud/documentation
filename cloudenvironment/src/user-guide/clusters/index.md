# Cluster Management
Clusters are logical groupings of nodes that work together to provide compute, storage, and networking resources for running instances and workloads. Pextra CloudEnvironment® supports the creation and management of clusters to facilitate resource allocation, scalability, and high availability.

The ID prefix for clusters is `cls-`[^4].

## Notes

[^4]: Resources in Pextra CloudEnvironment® are identified by unique IDs. Cluster IDs have the prefix `cls-`, followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `cls-YtR8FqvL29sKjb7WxD3Zn`).
