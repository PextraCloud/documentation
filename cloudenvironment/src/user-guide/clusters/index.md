# Cluster Management

The **Cluster Management** section allows administrators to manage cluster configurations and metadata within Pextra Cloud. Each cluster represents a logical grouping of nodes, resources, and workloads.

The ID prefix for clusters is `cls-`[^4].

> [!NOTE]
> Cluster licensing determines which organization-level features are enabled. Review [Organization Licensing](../organizations/licensing.md) for edition rules and gated capabilities.

## Notes

[^4]: Resources in Pextra CloudEnvironment® are identified by unique IDs. Cluster IDs have the prefix `cls-`, followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `cls-YtR8FqvL29sKjb7WxD3Zn`).
