# Instance Management

The **Instance Management** section allows administrators to manage virtual instances in the platform. It includes deployment, control, and lifecycle actions.

The ID prefix for instances is `inst-`[^2].

> [!TIP]
> You can perform these actions by **right-clicking** on the target node to deploy a new instance (VM or container). For management of existing instances, **right-click** on the instance itself.

> [!TIP]
> An instance must be in the **Stopped** state before it can be destroyed.

## Notes

[^2]: Resources in Pextra CloudEnvironment® are identified by unique IDs. Instance IDs will have the prefix `inst-`, followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `inst-RqP1zhgvLT3qasUOvI5DW`).
