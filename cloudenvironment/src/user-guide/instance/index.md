# Instance Management

Instances represent virtualized compute resources (VMs or containers) that run workloads within nodes in a cluster. Pextra CloudEnvironment® supports the open-source KVM hypervisor for instance virtualization, and LXC for containerization.


The ID prefix for instances is `inst-`[^2].

## Notes

[^2]: Resources in Pextra CloudEnvironment® are identified by unique IDs. Instance IDs will have the prefix `inst-`, followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `inst-RqP1zhgvLT3qasUOvI5DW`).
