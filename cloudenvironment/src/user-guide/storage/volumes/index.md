# Storage Volumes
Storage volumes (or just "volumes") are virtual storage devices that can be attached to instances. Volumes are allocated from storage pools, stored on individual nodes, and are used to store instance disks, snapshots, and other data.

Volumes can be attached to instances to provide additional storage capacity. Volumes can be resized, detached, and destroyed as needed.

The ID prefix for volumes is `vol-`[^1].

## Notes
[^1]: Resources in Pextra CloudEnvironmentÂ® are identified by unique IDs. Storage volume IDs will have the prefix `vol-`, followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `vol-qthm_iLrflJ_DtSS1l4Gx`).
