# Licensing
Pextra CloudEnvironment® uses a simple licensing model to manage access and feature availability in a multi-organization environment. Each node requires a valid, unexpired license key to operate; these licenses are aggregated at the cluster and organization levels to determine respective licensing status and edition.

> [!TIP]
> License keys can be purchased from the [Pextra Customer Portal](https://portal.pextra.cloud). Support subscriptions are also available for purchase.
