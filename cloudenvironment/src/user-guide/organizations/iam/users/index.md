# Users

Users are individual accounts created within an organization to allow access to resources based on assigned roles and policies. Each user has a unique username and can be assigned one or more roles that define their permissions.

The ID prefix for users is `user-`[^1].

## Notes

[^1]: Resources in Pextra CloudEnvironment® are identified by unique IDs. User IDs have the prefix `user-`, followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `user-YtR8FqvL29sKjb7WxD3Zn`).
