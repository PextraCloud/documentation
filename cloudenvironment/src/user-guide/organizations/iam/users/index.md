# Users

Users are individual accounts created within an organization to allow access to resources based on assigned roles and policies. Each user has a unique username and can be assigned one or more roles that define their permissions.

In order for the user to access the web interface, they must have at least the minimum permissions outlined in [Web Interface Permissions](../../../web-interface/logging-in/minimum-permissions.md).

The ID prefix for users is `user-`[^1].

## Notes

[^1]: Resources in Pextra CloudEnvironment® are identified by unique IDs. User IDs have the prefix `user-`, followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `user-YtR8FqvL29sKjb7WxD3Zn`).
