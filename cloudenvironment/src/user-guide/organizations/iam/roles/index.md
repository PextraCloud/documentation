# Roles
Roles are collections of policies that bundle permissions for assignment to users. Assigning a role to a user grants them all the permissions defined in the role's attached policies. Roles simplify permission management by allowing administrators to group related policies and assign them as a single unit.

The ID prefix for roles is `iamrole-`[^1].

## Notes

[^1]: Resources in Pextra CloudEnvironment® are identified by unique IDs. Role IDs have the prefix `iamrole-`, followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `iamrole-YtR8FqvL29sKjb7WxD3Zn`).
