# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

The **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** module allows administrators to manage users and roles within an organization.

Users are managed **at the organization level**. Administrators can:

- Add users individually or import multiple users in bulk using a CSV file.
- Manage access and permissions through **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.

## Accessing IAM

1. In the **left navigation panel**, click your **organization name**.
2. In the **right panel**, select **IAM** to open the user management view.
