# Auditing and Compliance
To monitor user activities and ensure compliance, Pextra CloudEnvironment® provides an audit trail feature that logs all actions taken by users within an organization. User lockout tracking is also available to help maintain security and compliance standards.

More advanced auditing features are planned for future releases.
