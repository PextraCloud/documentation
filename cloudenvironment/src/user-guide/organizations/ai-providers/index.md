# AI Providers
AI providers are organization-wide connections to cloud or self-hosted AI services. These providers power the [AI Assist](../../web-interface/ai-assist.md) feature, enabling users to use natural language to interact with the Pextra CloudEnvironment® web interface.

At least one AI provider must be configured and enabled for the AI Assist feature to function. If no AI providers are configured, the AI Assist feature will not be available in the web interface. For a list of supported AI providers, see the [Supported AI Providers](./supported.md) section.

The ID prefix for AI providers is `orgai-`[^1].

## Notes

[^1]: Resources in Pextra CloudEnvironment® are identified by unique IDs. AI providers will have the prefix `orgai-`, followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `orgai-qthm_iLrflJ_DtSS1l4Gx`).
