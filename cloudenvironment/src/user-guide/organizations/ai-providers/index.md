# AI Providers
AI providers are organization-wide connections to cloud or self-hosted AI services. These providers power various [AI features](../../web-interface/ai-features/index.md), enabling users to use natural language to interact with the Pextra CloudEnvironment® web interface.

At least one AI provider must be configured and enabled for AI features to function. If no AI providers are configured, AI features will not be available in the web interface. For a list of supported AI providers, see the [Supported AI Providers](./supported.md) section.

The ID prefix for AI providers is `orgai-`[^1].

## Notes

[^1]: Resources in Pextra CloudEnvironment® are identified by unique IDs. AI providers will have the prefix `orgai-`, followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `orgai-qthm_iLrflJ_DtSS1l4Gx`).
