# Organization Management

The **Organization Management** section allows administrators to manage and configure organizational tenants within Pextra CloudEnvironment®. Each organization is a fully isolated tenant with its own users, resources, and settings.

The ID prefix for organizations is `org-`[^1].

> [!TIP]
> The **root organization** is created automatically during installation. It has full administrative control over all other organizations in the environment.

> [!TIP]
> Currently, creating a new organization is supported **only via APIs**.

## Notes

[^1]: Resources in Pextra CloudEnvironment® are identified by unique IDs. Organization IDs have the prefix `org-`, followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `org-CIgLySkaAVeQ5kSLOodD3`).
